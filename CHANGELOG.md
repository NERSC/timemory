## Version 3.2.1

> Date: Fri Jul 9 16:55:33 2021 -0500

- pytimem fix
  - fix missing import of component_bundle and component_tuple
- added additional python tests
- Ability to build with static libraries: python bindings, mpip library, mallocp library, ompt library, ncclp library, KokkosP libraries
- Setting TIMEMORY_BUILD_PYTHON to OFF now results in searching for external pybind11 install
- Renamed some CMake files in cmake/Modules

- Added TIMEMORY_INSTALL_PYTHON option
- Fixed BUILD_STATIC_LIBS=ON + CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON
- Fixed TIMEMORY_USE_CUDA=ON + TIMEMORY_REQUIRE_PACKAGES=ON to fail
- If TIMEMORY_REQUIRED_PACKAGES=OFF, search for packages first before adding submodule
- Extended setup.py to support more options and support non-development install (no headers or cmake config)
- Removed TIMEMORY_EMBED_PYTHON option
- Disable timemory-jump when no shared libraries are built since dlopen isn't possible
- Replaced allocator member functions construct, destroy, allocate, deallocate with calls to static functions of allocator traits
- added support for CMAKE_ARGS env variable in setup.py
- remove absolute rpath when SKBUILD/SPACK_BUILD (since these have staging directories)
- timemory-{c,cxx,fortran} alias libraries in build tree
- toggled python function profiler to not include line number by default
  - This can cause strange results when generators are used
