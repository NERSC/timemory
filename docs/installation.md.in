| Clone the repository        | `git clone https://github.com/NERSC/timemory.git timemory`               |
| Create build directory      | `mkdir build-timemory && cd build-timemory`                              |
| Run CMake                   | `cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/timemory <CMAKE_OPTIONS> ../timemory` |
| Build and install (Windows) | `cmake --build . --target ALL && cmake --build . --target INSTALL`       |
| Build and install (UNIX)    | `cmake --build . --target all && cmake --build . --target install`       |

## CMake Options

Timemory uses a standard CMake installation. Set the environment variables `CC`, `CXX`, `CUDACXX` before
CMake is executed to define the specified compilers.
By default, timemory disables all extensions and build a very minimal configuration.
To enable auto-detection of packages, set `TIMEMORY_REQUIRE_PACKAGES=OFF` when there is no existing CMakeCache.txt
in the build directory. For the various external packages, timemory will search the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` in the
environment and enable CUDA, CUPTI, PAPI, MPI, etc. if it can find those packages.

For packages which are included as submodules (Caliper, GOTCHA, pybind11, etc.), there are two options:
`TIMEMORY_USE_<PACKAGE>` and `TIMEMORY_BUILD_<PACKAGE>`. The former specifies that support for the package
is desired, the latter specifies that this support should be enabled via the submodule. Thus,
if `TIMEMORY_USE_<PACKAGE>=OFF` then `TIMEMORY_BUILD_<PACKAGE>` is ignored. If `TIMEMORY_USE_<PACKAGE>=ON`
and `TIMEMORY_BUILD_<PACKAGE>=OFF`, then timemory will search for an external installation of the package.
If `TIMEMORY_USE_<PACKAGE>=ON` and `TIMEMORY_BUILD_<PACKAGE>=ON`, then timemory will use the built-in
submodule to enable support for the package.

## CMake Example

```console
mkdir build-timemory
cd build-timemory
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DTIMEMORY_USE_PAPI=ON -DTIMEMORY_USE_CUDA=ON ..
```
