# About

Timemory is a modular API for performance measurements and analysis with a very lightweight overhead.
If timemory does not support a particular measurement type or analysis method, user applications
can easily create their own component that accomplishes the desired task.

Timemory is implemented as a generic C++14 template library but supports implementation
in C, C++, Fortran, CUDA, and Python codes.
The design goal of timemory is to create an easy-to-use framework for generating
performance measurements and analysis methods which are extremely flexible
with respect to both how the data is stored/accumulated and which methods the measurement
or analysis supports. 

For a more extensive introduction and more information about the long-term goals, visit the
[README](https://github.com/NERSC/timemory/blob/develop/README.md) on GitHub.
