## Why Use TiMemory?

- Header-only interface for majority of C++ components
- Variadic interface to all the utilities from C code
- Variadic interface to all the utilities from C++ code
- Variadic interface to all the utilities from Python code
  - Includes context-managers and decorators
- Flexible and easily extensible interface: none of the components are restricted to a certain data type
- Create your own components: any one-time measurement or start/stop paradigm can be wrapped with timemory
- Direct access to performance data in native data structures for language
- High-performance: template meta-programming and lambda result in extensive inlining
- Ability to arbitrarily switch and combine different measurement types anywhere in application
- Provides static reporting (fixed at compile-time), dynamic reporting (selected at run-time), or hybrid
  - Enable static wall-clock and cpu-clock reporting with ability to dynamically enable hardware-counters at runtime
- Arbitrarily add support for:
  - CPU hardware counters via PAPI without an explicit PAPI dependency and zero `#ifdef`
  - GPU hardware counters via CUPTI without an explicit CUPTI dependency and zero `#ifdef`
  - Generating a roofline for performance-critical sections
  - Extensive tools provided by [Caliper](https://github.com/LLNL/Caliper)
  - Colored CUDA NVTX markers
  - Memory usage
  - Wall-clock, cpu-clock, system-clock timing
  - Number of bytes read/written to file-system (and rate)
  - Number of context switches
  - Trip counts
  - CUDA kernel runtime(s)
