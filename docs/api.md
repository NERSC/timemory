# API

This section provides the high-level details for general and toolkit usage.
The library and Python APIs are recommended for general use and the C++ toolkit
is recommended for building performance monitoring frameworks into their APIs.
Detailed documentation on the toolkit API can be found in the [Doxygen](doxygen.md)
section.
