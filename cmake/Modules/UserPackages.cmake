#   This file exists for the user to applications to create their own interface
#   libraries that are exported along with the rest of the library

#       See Packages.cmake for several examples on how this is done. In general,
#       follow pattern of:
#
#       add_interface_library(timemory-<SOME_PACKAGE>)
#
#       find_package(<SOME_PACKAGE>)
#       if(<SOME_PACKAGE>_FOUND)
#           # populate target flags, definitions, etc.
#       else()
#           inform_empty_interface(timemory-<SOME_PACKAGE> "brief about <SOME_PACKAGE>")
#       endif()
